HELLO HACKPSU!

We're chilling in the basement of the Business Building here at Penn State working on our project for this semester's HackPSU hackathon! What is it? Announcing....

DOGPICS!

We're building a Python+Flask web application to comb through images, determine what is a dog, and display pictures of dogs to a user.  

We plan on using OpenCV to do the image recognition on our images to determine if there is a dog or not.  We hope to use the Imgur API to get images.
